# Update Footer with Instagram

## Why
The current footer contains copyright information and a contact email, but doesn't reflect the couple's social media presence. Adding Instagram links with the couple's usernames (_mawson and zixinzhang920) styled in the existing cursive font (Weddingday) with Instagram icons will create a more personal and modern footer that encourages guests to connect on social media.

## What Changes
- Replace existing footer content with Instagram social links for both Sally and Elisha
- Add Instagram icon SVG or use an icon library for visual representation
- Style footer to display both Instagram profiles side-by-side with the Weddingday cursive font
- Ensure responsive layout for mobile and desktop displays
- Maintain consistent footer styling across all pages (index.html, details.html, rsvp.html, photos.html)
- Remove or optionally relocate copyright and email contact information
