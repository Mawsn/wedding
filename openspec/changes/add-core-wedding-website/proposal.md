# Add Core Wedding Website

## Why
Sally and Elisha need a wedding RSVP website that allows guests to confirm attendance and view wedding details. The site must be simple, beautiful, mobile-friendly, and easy to maintain with potential for future photo-sharing features.

## What Changes
- Create static website structure with modular HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Implement RSVP form integrated with Google Forms
- Design responsive layout for mobile and desktop (Australian audience)
- Set up basic website sections: Home, Details, RSVP, Photos (placeholder)
- Configure for GitHub Pages hosting
- Implement PWA capabilities for offline access and app-like experience

## Impact
- Affected specs: `rsvp-form`, `website-structure`, `photo-sharing` (initial capability, detailed implementation future)
- Affected code: New implementation - no existing code
- External dependencies: Google Forms API, GitHub Pages
- Hosting: Static site on GitHub Pages
