# Project Context

## Purpose
To create a wedding RSVP website (PWA) for Sally and Elisha that is beautiful and easy to navigate with the potential to extend the site adding cool features a photo cpatue/upload feature for guests to use on the day

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScipt (any framework is fine)
- Google Docs as a psudeo backend (Google Forms for RSVPs maybe, maybe Google Drive for photos)
- Python, Docker and anything else devops-y would be cool but only if necessary/beneficial. I am from a DevOps background so that'd be fun!

## Project Conventions

### Code Style
No strong preferences but I am from an AWS CDK Python background so keep it similar to that would be a "nice to have". Keeping the website modular/easy to add features would be a huge win.

### Architecture Patterns
Keep it as modula as possible, allowing for expansions of the site like a photo upload/capture section etc. It needs to be easy to jump in and maintain 

### Testing Strategy
No testing required whatsoever!!

### Git Workflow
I don't have a preference, just do not commit straight to main. 

## Domain Context
This site will be used in Australia across mobile and desktop devices.

## Important Constraints
N/A - the hope is to make this a static website. I plan to host on GitHub pages but if you think there is a lot to gain by having a dynamic website. I am open to hosting somewhere. It's up to you!

## External Dependencies
