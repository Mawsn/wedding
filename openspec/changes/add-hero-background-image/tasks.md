- [x] 8.5 Test on desktop (1440px width)
- [x] 8.6 Test on ultra-wide (2560px width)
- [x] 8.7 Verify no image cropping on any size

## 9. Visual Quality Assurance
- [x] 9.1 Verify blur effect looks natural, not jarring
- [x] 9.2 Check for visible seams between sharp and blur layers
- [x] 9.3 Ensure image focal point (couple) is properly centered
- [x] 9.4 Verify text remains prominently visible
- [x] 9.5 Check color consistency across layers
- [x] 9.6 Test with different browser zoom levels
