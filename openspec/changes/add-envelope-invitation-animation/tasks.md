# Implementation Tasks

## 1. Setup and Configuration
- [x] 1.1 Create animation configuration object with `animationOn` toggle in a new module `js/modules/invitation-animation.js`
- [x] 1.2 Add visitor tracking logic using localStorage to detect first-time visitors
- [x] 1.3 Verify `invite.JPG` exists and is web-optimized; create compressed version if needed

## 2. HTML Structure
- [x] 2.1 Add animation overlay container structure to `index.html` (before closing body tag)
- [x] 2.2 Create semantic HTML for envelope, wax seal, invitation card elements
- [x] 2.3 Add skip button for accessibility and user control
- [x] 2.4 Add appropriate ARIA labels and roles for screen readers

## 3. CSS Styling - Base Styles
- [x] 3.1 Create `css/components/invitation-animation.css` file
- [x] 3.2 Style the full-screen overlay with blurred/greyed background
- [x] 3.3 Design cream-colored envelope with proper dimensions and perspective
- [x] 3.4 Style "Sally and Elisha Wedding Invitation" text overlay
- [x] 3.5 Create wax seal design with "Tap to open" instructional text
- [x] 3.6 Style invitation card to display `invite.JPG` appropriately

## 4. CSS Animations - Keyframes
- [x] 4.1 Create `@keyframes` for envelope spotlight entrance (fade in with scale)
- [x] 4.2 Create `@keyframes` for envelope flip animation (3D rotateY transform)
- [x] 4.3 Create `@keyframes` for envelope opening (split top flap animation)
- [x] 4.4 Create `@keyframes` for invitation slide-out (translateY with fade)
- [x] 4.5 Add subtle pulse animation to wax seal to indicate interactivity
- [x] 4.6 Ensure all animations use GPU-accelerated properties (transform, opacity)

## 5. JavaScript Animation Logic
- [x] 5.1 Implement animation module initialization in `js/modules/invitation-animation.js`
- [x] 5.2 Add first-visit detection and localStorage management
- [x] 5.3 Implement animation state machine (stages: spotlight → flip → sealed → opening → complete)
- [x] 5.4 Add wax seal click/tap event listener to trigger opening sequence
- [x] 5.5 Add skip button functionality to bypass animation
- [x] 5.6 Implement animation completion handler to remove overlay and show main content
- [x] 5.7 Add cleanup logic to remove `will-change` properties after animations complete

## 6. Performance Optimization
- [x] 6.1 Use CSS `transform` and `opacity` exclusively for animations (avoid layout thrashing)
- [x] 6.2 Apply `will-change` property strategically and remove after animation
- [x] 6.3 Add `content-visibility: auto` to hidden elements
- [x] 6.4 Compress `invite.JPG` if file size is >500KB (file is 121KB, no compression needed)
- [x] 6.5 Lazy load invitation image only when needed

## 7. Accessibility and User Experience
- [x] 7.1 Check and respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query (skip or simplify animations)
- [x] 7.2 Ensure keyboard accessibility (Enter/Space to activate seal, Escape to skip)
- [x] 7.3 Add focus management for skip button
- [x] 7.4 Test with screen reader (ensure meaningful announcements)
- [x] 7.5 Add optional auto-dismiss after 15 seconds if user doesn't interact

## 8. Integration and Configuration
- [x] 8.1 Import animation module in `js/app.js`
- [x] 8.2 Initialize animation conditionally based on `animationOn` config and first-visit status
- [x] 8.3 Link `css/components/invitation-animation.css` in `index.html`
- [x] 8.4 Document configuration options in code comments

## 9. Testing and Validation
- [x] 9.1 Test on modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [x] 9.2 Test on mobile devices (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
- [x] 9.3 Test on older smartphones (4-5 years old) for performance
- [x] 9.4 Verify localStorage persistence across sessions
- [x] 9.5 Test with `animationOn = false` configuration
- [x] 9.6 Test with reduced motion preferences enabled
- [x] 9.7 Verify no JavaScript errors in console
- [x] 9.8 Test keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility

## 10. Polish and Documentation
- [x] 10.1 Fine-tune animation timing and easing functions for smooth feel
- [x] 10.2 Add inline code comments explaining animation stages
- [x] 10.3 Update README.md with animation feature documentation (if needed)
- [x] 10.4 Create fallback for browsers without localStorage support
