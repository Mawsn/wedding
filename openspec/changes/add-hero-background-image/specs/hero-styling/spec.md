# Hero Styling Capability

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Hero Background Image Display
The system SHALL display a custom background image in the hero section that adapts to different screen sizes.

#### Scenario: Hero image displays on mobile
- **WHEN** a user views the hero section on a mobile device
- **THEN** the full background image is visible without cropping

- **WHEN** a user views the hero section on a desktop device
- **THEN** the background image fills the hero area naturally
- **AND** no awkward cropping or excessive zoom is applied
- **AND** the image maintains visual appeal at larger sizes

### Requirement: iOS-Style Blur Extension
The system SHALL implement an adaptive blur extension technique to fill larger viewports naturally without cropping or repetition.

#### Scenario: Blur extension on large screens
- **WHEN** the viewport is wider than the optimal image display size
- **THEN** a blurred version of the image extends beyond the sharp focal area
- **AND** the blur creates a natural edge transition
- **AND** no hard edges or repetition patterns are visible

#### Scenario: Blur intensity adapts to screen size
- **WHEN** the hero section is viewed on different screen sizes
- **THEN** the blur intensity adjusts appropriately per breakpoint
- **AND** mobile displays show minimal or no blur
- **AND** ultra-wide displays show more prominent blur extension

#### Scenario: Sharp focal point preserved
- **WHEN** the blur extension technique is active
- **THEN** the central focal point of the image remains sharp and clear
- **AND** the transition from sharp to blur is gradual and natural
- **AND** the couple's image in the photo is clearly visible

### Requirement: Text Readability Over Background
The system SHALL ensure all hero text remains readable over the background image.

#### Scenario: Text contrast with overlay
- **WHEN** text is displayed over the hero background image
- **THEN** a semi-transparent overlay enhances text visibility
- **AND** white text has sufficient contrast for readability
- **AND** the overlay doesn't obscure the background image excessively

#### Scenario: Readable text across all devices
- **WHEN** the hero section is viewed on different devices
- **THEN** all text elements (title, subtitle, date, location, buttons) are clearly readable
- **AND** text maintains WCAG AA contrast requirements
- **AND** text-shadow or overlay provides adequate separation from background

### Requirement: Responsive Background Adaptation
The system SHALL adapt the hero background presentation across all viewport sizes.

#### Scenario: Mobile portrait background
- **WHEN** viewed on mobile portrait orientation (320px-767px)
- **THEN** the full image displays with cover sizing
- **AND** critical image content (couple) is centered and visible
- **AND** no blur extension is applied

#### Scenario: Tablet background
- **WHEN** viewed on tablet devices (768px-1023px)
- **THEN** the image transitions to blur extension technique
- **AND** the sharp overlay begins to fade at edges
- **AND** the overall appearance remains balanced

#### Scenario: Desktop background
- **WHEN** viewed on desktop devices (1024px-1919px)
- **THEN** the blur extension is fully active
- **AND** the sharp center focal point is prominent
- **AND** blurred edges fill the viewport naturally

#### Scenario: Ultra-wide background
- **WHEN** viewed on ultra-wide displays (1920px+)
- **THEN** increased blur intensity fills the extra width
- **AND** the sharp overlay opacity is reduced for balance
- **AND** no repetition or awkward scaling occurs

### Requirement: Image Performance Optimization
The system SHALL optimize hero background image loading for performance.

#### Scenario: Optimized image delivery
- **WHEN** the hero section loads
- **THEN** compressed image variants are served based on viewport size
- **AND** WebP format is used for supported browsers
- **AND** PNG fallback is provided for older browsers

#### Scenario: Fast initial page load
- **WHEN** a user first accesses the website
- **THEN** the hero image loads without blocking page render
- **AND** the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) is under 2.5 seconds
- **AND** no significant Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) occurs

#### Scenario: Offline image availability
- **WHEN** the website is accessed offline after initial visit
- **THEN** the cached hero background image loads successfully
- **AND** the service worker serves the image from cache
- **AND** the user experience is unaffected by offline status

### Requirement: Background Image Quality
The system SHALL maintain visual quality of the hero background image across all devices.

#### Scenario: Sharp image on high-DPI displays
- **WHEN** the hero section is viewed on retina/high-DPI displays
- **THEN** the image appears sharp without pixelation
- **AND** appropriate image resolution is served for device pixel ratio
- **AND** the blur effect remains smooth and natural

#### Scenario: Natural blur appearance
- **WHEN** the blur extension technique is applied
- **THEN** the blur appears natural and intentional
- **AND** no visible artifacts or banding occurs
- **AND** the blur radius is appropriate for the screen size

#### Scenario: Color consistency
- **WHEN** the hero background displays across layers
- **THEN** color consistency is maintained between sharp and blurred layers
- **AND** no color shifts or tone differences are visible
- **AND** the overall aesthetic matches the wedding theme

### Requirement: Cross-Browser Compatibility
The system SHALL ensure the hero background displays correctly across all supported browsers.

#### Scenario: Modern browser support
- **WHEN** the website is accessed on modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **THEN** the hero background with blur extension displays correctly
- **AND** all CSS filters and transforms are applied properly
- **AND** no visual glitches or rendering issues occur

#### Scenario: Fallback for older browsers
- **WHEN** the website is accessed on browsers without CSS filter support
- **THEN** a graceful fallback is provided (standard background-size: cover)
- **AND** the experience remains acceptable without blur extension
- **AND** text readability is maintained

### Requirement: Background Image Accessibility
The system SHALL ensure the hero background implementation is accessible.

#### Scenario: Decorative background handling
- **WHEN** assistive technologies access the hero section
- **THEN** the background image is correctly identified as decorative
- **AND** no alt text or ARIA labels are required for the background
- **AND** the background doesn't interfere with content navigation

#### Scenario: High contrast mode compatibility
- **WHEN** a user enables high contrast mode
- **THEN** the hero text remains visible and readable
- **AND** the background image doesn't override user preferences
- **AND** sufficient contrast is maintained for accessibility
