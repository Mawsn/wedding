# Spec: Intro Animation

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Envelope Animation Sequence
The system SHALL display a three-stage animated envelope opening sequence when a first-time visitor loads `index.html`, presenting the wedding invitation in a delightful and engaging manner.

#### Scenario: First-time visitor sees complete animation
- **WHEN** a user visits `index.html` for the first time
- **AND** animation is enabled via configuration (`animationOn = true`)
- **AND** user has not disabled motion preferences (`prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference`)
- **THEN** the system displays a full-screen overlay with blurred/greyed background
- **AND** animates a cream-colored envelope with "Sally and Elisha Wedding Invitation" text (Stage 1: Spotlight, 0-1.5s)
- **AND** flips the envelope to reveal the back with a wax seal (Stage 2: Flip, 1.5-3s)
- **AND** displays "Tap to open" text with a pulsing wax seal awaiting user interaction
- **AND** marks the visitor as having seen the animation in localStorage

#### Scenario: User taps wax seal to open envelope
- **WHEN** the envelope animation is at the wax seal stage (Stage 3)
- **AND** the user taps/clicks on the wax seal element
- **THEN** the system animates the envelope top flap opening upward (Stage 4: Opening, ~1s)
- **AND** slides the invitation card (`/images/invite.JPG`) out from the envelope (Stage 5: Slide out, ~1.5s)
- **AND** scales up and displays the invitation prominently
- **AND** after a 2-second display, fades out the overlay
- **AND** reveals the main website content beneath

#### Scenario: User skips animation via skip button
- **WHEN** the envelope animation is playing at any stage
- **AND** the user clicks/taps the skip button in the top-right corner
- **THEN** the system immediately halts all animations
- **AND** removes the animation overlay
- **AND** displays the main website content
- **AND** marks the visitor as having seen the animation

#### Scenario: Animation auto-dismisses after timeout
- **WHEN** the envelope animation reaches the wax seal stage (Stage 3)
- **AND** the user does not interact with the wax seal for 15 seconds
- **THEN** the system automatically triggers the opening sequence
- **AND** proceeds with the complete animation to reveal the invitation
- **AND** completes the animation flow as if the user had tapped the seal

### Requirement: Performance Optimization
The system SHALL ensure the envelope animation performs smoothly on older smartphones (4-5 years old) by using GPU-accelerated CSS properties and optimizing animation techniques.

#### Scenario: Animation uses only GPU-accelerated properties
- **WHEN** the envelope animation is executing
- **THEN** the system uses only CSS `transform` (translate, scale, rotate) and `opacity` properties for all animations
- **AND** avoids layout-triggering properties such as `left`, `top`, `width`, `height`, `margin`, `padding`

#### Scenario: Will-change optimization lifecycle
- **WHEN** an animation stage begins
- **THEN** the system applies `will-change: transform, opacity` to the animating elements
- **AND** when the animation stage completes, removes the `will-change` property to free GPU memory

#### Scenario: Invitation image is lazy-loaded
- **WHEN** the envelope animation begins at Stage 1
- **THEN** the system starts preloading `/images/invite.JPG` in the background
- **AND** the image is fully loaded before Stage 5 (invitation slide-out)
- **AND** if the image fails to load, displays a fallback text-only invitation message

### Requirement: Visual Design
The system SHALL present the envelope animation with appropriate styling, colors, and visual effects to create an elegant and polished experience.

#### Scenario: Full-screen overlay with background blur
- **WHEN** the envelope animation is active
- **THEN** the system displays a full-screen overlay (z-index above main content)
- **AND** applies a backdrop-filter blur (8-12px) to the underlying page content
- **AND** applies a semi-transparent dark overlay (rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)) for contrast

#### Scenario: Cream envelope with proper styling
- **WHEN** the envelope appears in Stage 1 (Spotlight)
- **THEN** the system displays a cream/beige colored envelope (#F5F5DC or similar)
- **AND** centers the envelope on screen with appropriate sizing (max 600px width on desktop, 90% width on mobile)
- **AND** displays "Sally and Elisha Wedding Invitation" text overlaid on the envelope front
- **AND** uses appropriate typography (wedding font or elegant serif)

#### Scenario: Wax seal with interaction cue
- **WHEN** the envelope flips to reveal the back (Stage 2 complete)
- **THEN** the system displays a circular wax seal centered on the envelope back
- **AND** applies a red/burgundy color (#8B0000 or similar) to the seal
- **AND** displays "Tap to open" text beneath or inside the seal
- **AND** animates a subtle pulse effect (scale 1.0 to 1.05) to indicate interactivity

#### Scenario: Skip button is clearly visible
- **WHEN** the envelope animation is active
- **THEN** the system displays a "Skip" button in the top-right corner
- **AND** styles the button with high contrast (white text on dark background or vice versa)
- **AND** ensures minimum tap target size of 44x44 pixels for mobile accessibility
- **AND** button remains visible and accessible throughout all animation stages

### Requirement: Animation Timing and Sequencing
The system SHALL coordinate animation stages with appropriate timing, transitions, and easing functions to create a smooth and natural flow.

#### Scenario: Stage 1 - Spotlight entrance timing
- **WHEN** the envelope animation begins
- **THEN** the overlay fades in over 0.3 seconds
- **AND** the envelope scales from 0.8 to 1.0 with fade-in over 1.2 seconds
- **AND** uses `ease-out` easing function for natural deceleration

#### Scenario: Stage 2 - Flip transition timing
- **WHEN** Stage 1 completes (at 1.5s mark)
- **THEN** the envelope flips 180Â° around Y-axis over 1.5 seconds
- **AND** uses `ease-in-out` easing for smooth rotation
- **AND** maintains 3D perspective transform for depth effect

#### Scenario: Stage 3 - Wax seal pulse animation
- **WHEN** the envelope flip completes and back is visible
- **THEN** the wax seal begins a continuous pulse animation
- **AND** scales from 1.0 to 1.05 and back over 2 seconds
- **AND** repeats infinitely until user interaction or timeout

#### Scenario: Stage 4 - Envelope opening timing
- **WHEN** user taps wax seal or auto-dismiss triggers
- **THEN** the envelope top flap rotates upward around X-axis over 1.0 second
- **AND** uses `ease-out` easing function

#### Scenario: Stage 5 - Invitation slide-out timing
- **WHEN** envelope opening completes
